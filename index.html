            <p><strong>I am a senior researcher at Tencent America.</strong></p>
            <p>I received my PhD in Computer Science at UC Irvine, where I had been conducting research since Fall 2019 under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://www.stephanmandt.com/">Stephan Mandt</a>. My research primarily focuses on developing neural-based approaches for image/video compression and generation. Beyond my core research, I am passionate about exploring applications of deep generative models across diverse domains, particularly in natural science and music.</p>
            <p>Before joining UC Irvine, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from NYU Shanghai. During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working as a research assistant with Prof. <a href="http://www.musicxlab.com/members/gus/">Gus Xia</a>, where I investigated generative modeling applications in music. Additionally, I collaborated with Prof. <a href="https://www.hanghuichen.org/">Hanghui Chen</a> on physics research, gaining valuable interdisciplinary experience.</p>
